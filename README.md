# CS457-P1
CS 457 Fall 2022 Project 1: Chat Program in C 
Language: C/C++ Total: 100 Points 
Introduction 
In this project, you need to use socket programming written in C to implement a simple chat 
capability. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that you read Beej's Guide to Network Programming 
- Using Internet Sockets (https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_usl_c_1.pdf) to help you with this
project.

This assignment consists of one program that acts as both the client and the server. The program 
communicates simple messages back and forth, starting with the client sending a connection 
request to the server. Test your code by running your client on one machine and your server on 
another. Chat is strictly back and forth; after sending a message, the program waits to receive it 
before sending it again (see example interaction). Messages may be up to 140 characters and 
should be checked by the program. Print an error message and ask for a new message if the user 
inputs more than 140 characters. Finally, you need to complete the given source code file chat.cpp
files for this assignment. The makefile is given for this project, and you must use this file to test 
your project. Your code must work on the Linux machines in the 120 Linux Lab. 
Remember: It is your responsibility to test your project on the Linux machines in the 120 
Linux Lab - that is where the GTAs grade the project. 


chat.cpp Requirements 

The program is invoked as follows: 
Server-side: $ ./chat 
Client side: $ ./chat -p 3790 -s 129.82.44.141 or ./chat -s 129.82.44.141 -p 3790 
The -p flag indicates the port to connect to, and the -s flag indicates the IP address of your friend. 
The order (-p followed by -s / -s followed by -p) must work. 
Help Command: $ ./chat -h 
Should produce a help message and exit. 
The chat program acts as a server without any arguments, prints out the port it is listening 
on, and waits for a connection. 
With arguments, the program acts as a client connects to a waiting server using the 
information provided. 
With one argument, the program prints the help message and exits. 
The arguments may be in any order and should be sanity-checked. For example, a port must 
be a number (no letters), and a server address must also be numbered. Still, with the "." 
character allowed.

# Server 
1. Set up a TCP port and listen for connections (print out IP and PORT is listening on). 
2. Accept connection from client 
3. Block to receive a message from the client. 
4. Receive message and print to screen. 
5. Prompt the user for a message to send. 
6. Send the message to the client. 
7. GOTO step 3.
# Client 
1. Set up a TCP connection to the server on the IP and port specified. 
2. Prompt the user for a message to send. 
3. Send the message to the server. 
4. Block to receive a message from the server. 
5. Receive message and print to screen. 
6. GOTO step 2.
Note: The programs continue until terminated (ctrl + c) by the user. 

# Makefile 
You must use the given makefile that produces an executable called chat. Do not modify the 
makefile. 

# Interaction Requirements 
Programs are randomly paired up and have their client and server tested with the other's client and 
server. To make this possible, you must follow the packet format specified below." Remember to 
use the correct byte order (endianness) for the packets. Packets sent on the network should have 
Big-Endian byte order and then be converted back to match the host when they are received. Refer 
to Beej's Guide for more information.
 

# Grading 
 No credit is given to a program that fails to compile on the department's Linux machines. 

10% input flags accepted in any order and sanity-checked. 

10% Program produces an error and asks for another message if the message is over 140 
characters. 

10% Program uses network-to-host and host-to-network. 

10% Program work with another team's randomly chosen client and server. 

50% Program passes send/receive test cases. 

10% Output formatting looks like the example.

Points 
This exercise is worth 100 points. Overall, projects are worth 25% of your total grade. Therefore, 
this project is worth 10% of your total grade.

# Extra Credits 20 Points 
In this extended version, you need to create multiple sockets to exchange messages between users 
and server. From the server's end, each user is given a numerical ID. The number of message 
exchanges between users and the server is limited. There is no way for a user to send a text to 
another user. Any user can receive a message from the only server. A user types and sends the 
message and waits to receive a response from the server. The server receives texts continuously 
from the users. To reply, the server gives the user id and then :: symbol and then messages. For 
example, if the server wants to send "Welcome to CS457 Fall-21 Class" to user 5, the input must 
be 5: Welcome to CS457 Fall-21 Class. User 5 receives only "Welcome to CS457 Fall-21 Class," 
and the rest of the parts are discarded. Users send messages directly to the server without adding 
any id number and symbol (::).
